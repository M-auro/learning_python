# Variables are used to store values, and they are created when you assign a value to it.
# Example of variableS

x = 10           # Integer
y = 3.14         # Float
name = "frodo"   # string
is_cool = True   # Boolean

# To print the value of a variable, you can use the print
print(x)

# You can also assign multiple variables in one line
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 

# You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
d = e = f = 4

# You can also assign a variable to another variable
g = h = 5
g = h
