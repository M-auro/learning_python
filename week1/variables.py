# Variables are used to store values, and they are created when you assign a value to it.
# Example of variableS

X = 10           # Integer
Y = 3.14         # Float
NAME = "frodo"   # string
IS_COOL = True   # Boolean

# To print the value of a variable, you can use the print
print(X)

# You can also assign multiple variables in one line
A, B, C = 1, 2, 3 

# You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
D = E = F = 4

# You can also assign a variable to another variable
G = H = 5
G = H
